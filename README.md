## tk-rnaseq:  RNA-Seq analysis toolkit
Daniel S. Standage: <daniel.standage@gmail.com>

**14 Nov 2013**: A project I am working on has an RNA-Seq component that has demanded my attention for several months now. In pursuit of this project, I have been copying data back and forth between several machines, leaving a disheveled pile of half-baked READMEs, scripts, and procedures in my wake. I'm OK with this--most of the little scripts I write as part of my research will never again see the light of day. But there are some that I keep re-using and re-adapting over and over again.

This package is my effort to centralize the most important RNA-Seq analysis scripts and procedures that I keep coming back to: the ones worth documenting and generalizing so that I or anyone else can come back in 3-6 months, know what the heck everything is and does, and use them for something else.

Rather than creating a directory and README for each tool, for now I am placing each tool's documentation in that tool's source code. I'm expect this will be a satisfactory solution for most of the tools I store in the package.
